![A photo of the moon over a town and country scene](/images/2005/11/moon-over-failsworth.png)

The moon was huge and very present as I drove up the M6 the other night. It was still hanging around in the morning, as you can see. In the distance you can see Salton Mill. There was another mill, when I was a lad, in the middle distance (where the new houses can be seen) â€“ Argyll Mill, I think.
